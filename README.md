CampusCardReader
================

This is a small application for android which reads some values of CampusCards.

Currently supported are the following CampusCards:

-HS Osnabrueck  
-Universität Osnabrueck  
-Universität Leipzig  
-TU Darmstadt  


In theory the universities contained in the following link should also work:
http://www.intercard.org/de/referenzen/referenzen.html

However some other CampusCards which are produced by Intercard may or may not work.

//TODO
================
+ find a way to read everything on the card, e.g. name,... (contact me if you happen to know how it works)


Compile Instructions
================
just change the config file to include your devices and your admob adunit id
