CampusCardReader
================

This is a small application for android which reads some values of CampusCards.

Currently supported are the following CampusCards:

HS Osnabrueck
Universit√§t Osnabrueck


In theory the universitys contained in the following link should also work:
http://www.intercard.org/de/referenzen/referenzen.html

However some other CampusCards which are produced by Intercard may or may not work.

//TODO
================
+ you can't read a campuscard if the app isn't open - has to be fixed
